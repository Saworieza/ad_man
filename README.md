ad_man
======

Ad_man is an advertising manager mountable engine.  It allows the user to upload and manage advertising banners, and provides an easy to use helper for inserting the banners on your website.  Also allows counting the number of times an ad has shown, as well as being able to set a keyword location for the ads.

Currently supports two image sizes for advertising: Banner: 468 x 60 and Leaderboard: 728 x 90. 
TODO: Will implement 9 different sizes as mentioned by google's adwords requirements.

Uses Paperclip, and requires ImageMagick be running on the server.
